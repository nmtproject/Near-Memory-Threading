# Guide

the main script is "riscv2binary.sh", the file "getbin.exe" is used by the script so both need to be in the same folder.

exampel of set-up:

pwd/test_folder:

getbin.exe   riscv2binary.sh   codeinriscv 

when using the script use the following line:

./riscv2binary.sh codeinriscv output

and output should look like:

intruction_memory[0] = 32b' ...
intruction_memory[1] = 32b' ...
intruction_memory[2] = 32b' ...
intruction_memory[3] = 32b' ...

etc.
